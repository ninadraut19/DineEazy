## Functional Requirements:
The core and  the primary objective of this Web based Application is to provide diner a platform that allows  to make online table reservations at their favourite restaurants and can check out the menu of their choice from a restaurant as per their convenience. The second most objective is to provide an online platform for a restaurant owners to post their restaurant on the proposed web application so as to grow in the business. In manual system, everything depends upon waiter & booking diary and there is no automated system for keeping the records.  Therefore it is aimed to develop an application for table reservation and online menu booking. This idea is discovered by keeping in mind the fact that people consider it a pain to go to the restaurant because of absolute amount of time required to find a desired one. Also itâ€™s difficult to get a booking and equally time consuming to go through the menu and then to order the dishes. In addition to that the restaurant Managers have to analyse and keep hundreds of paper receipts to maintain the records and hence this application may help the restaurant in a digital way by keeping track of the bookings through the admin portal provided. The customer has to become a member first then he can access the later part of the application for which first of all registration is a compulsion but the same is not applicable for a normal visitor to web application as he/she can still check out some features. The customer can check availability of seats at a particular timing and book a seat if available. The customer is also given with the facility to view the booking details and can cancel the booking if required. If failed to arrive on time the booking request will automatically be cancelled from Restaurant side and amount will not be refunded. The pre-ordering of food is the great feature for diner in addition to table reservation. The customer can go thought various cuisines and food items listed on application where he/she can select the food and add to his/her basket and can processed with confirmation to place an pre-order for the given time slot and thus this idea will eventually It saves diner's time looking out for restaurants. Also it saves business assets and costs.
